"""
    The purpose of the class is only the be able to write the data from the TrackBall class into a file
    It writes the data in a csv format with the following columns: expID, temps, x, y, speed
    The expID is a unique identifier for each experiment, it is incremented by 1 for each new experiment.
    The temps is the frame number of the video, it is incremented by 1 for each new frame.
    The x and y are the coordinates of the ball in the frame.
    The speed is the speed of the ball calculated from the positions.
